* initial-architecture-diagram.png
  * Details the initial architecture diagram designed for the pipeline including all the relevant cloud-based services (AWS) and how they work together.
* final-architecture-diagram.png
  * A refined architecture diagram, showing any development changes made throughout the process of the project. When compared to the initial architecture diagram, it details how we refined the initial pipeline process by altering some of the cloud services used, in order to optimise efficiency and cost benefit.
